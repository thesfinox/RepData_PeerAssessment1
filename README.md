# Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1

This is the submission for the first course project in the **Reproducible Research** course in the **Data Science** specialisation by the John Hopkins University.

## Analysis

The analysis performed on the **activity monitoring data** of wearable devices can be fully reconstructed using the `R` file `run_analysis.R`.

The `R Markdown` file `PA1_template.Rmd` contains the code to generate the notebook of the analysis with text alongside the code. Using **Knitr** we also provide the _HTML_ and _PDF_ versions of the notebook.
